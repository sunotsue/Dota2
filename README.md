# Dota2

In January 2018, I participated in the "Kings of Machine Learning" hackathon hosted online by the D.E. Shaw Group on Analytics Vidhya.
Out of the 1503 participants, my teammates and I (Team "Serendipity") ranked 81st on the Private Leaderboard. In this repository, you'll find details on how I've applied data preprocessing/feature engineering and dimension reducing techniques to kda_ratio for the popular online game Dota2. Following are the information regarding the competition (https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/kings-of-machine-learning/).
